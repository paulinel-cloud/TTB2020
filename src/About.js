                We are three students from Northern California who have been indirectly
                affected by the catastrophic wildfires that have been ravaging California for
                the past couple of years. We decided to connect this to climate change because
                we have personally observed the extreme weather patterns and temperature extremes
                with the worsening of Northern California wildfires.
